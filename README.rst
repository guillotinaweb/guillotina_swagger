Introduction
============

This project is an attempt to provide easy swagger integration for your
guillotina application.


ToDo
----

- authenticate before getting swagger definition
  - swagger-ui provides a mechanism to provide your own swagger def inline
    - download manually with auth, then without
- integrate with guillotina api so you can traverse objects and see the API
